FILES:

Main.java

Assignement3.sql

pom.xml

INSTRUCTIONS:

Make sure you have a postgres server running and add Assignment3.sql as a database

This was done as a project in Intellj, I cannot figure out proper compile instructions:

I guess download Intellj if you don't have it, create a new Maven project and copy and paste in Main.java and pom.xml?

Then change the url, user, and password

Run the main to test
